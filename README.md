## Background Context
The goal of the project is to deploy on our server a simple copy of the [AirBnB website](https://www.airbnb.com/).

I wonâ€™t implement all the features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

After 4 months, I will have a complete web application composed by:
- A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
- A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
- A database or files that store data (data = objects)
- An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)
